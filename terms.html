                    <p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Atom, Sudoku, Digits, Minesweeper, Random Race, Selio, Hexis, Roku, Brevity</p>
                    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 11, 2026</p>

                    <h3>Agreement to Terms</h3>

                    <p>By downloading or using any of our apps (Atom, Sudoku, Digits, Minesweeper, Random Race, Selio, Hexis, Roku, or Brevity), these terms will automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the apps.</p>

                    <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>

                    <p>You're not allowed to copy or modify the apps, any part of the apps, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the apps, and you also shouldn't try to translate the apps into other languages or make derivative versions. The apps themselves, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to them, belong to Welles Liu.</p>

                    <h3>Changes and Pricing</h3>

                    <p>Welles Liu is committed to ensuring that the apps are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the apps or to charge for services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the apps or their services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.</p>

                    <h3>Your Data</h3>

                    <p>Our apps store data locally on your device (such as game progress, settings, or preferences) to provide the service. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any server. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the apps secure.</p>

                    <p>We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and could mean that the apps won't work properly or at all.</p>

                    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

                    <p>Our apps use platform services required for distribution:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Services</a> (Android)</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple App Store</a> (iOS)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Connectivity</h3>

                    <p>Certain functions of the apps may require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Welles Liu cannot take responsibility for the apps not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.</p>

                    <p>If you're using the apps outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the apps, or other third-party charges. In using the apps, you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the apps outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.</p>

                    <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

                    <p>Welles Liu cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the apps. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail the service, Welles Liu cannot accept responsibility.</p>

                    <p>With respect to Welles Liu's responsibility for your use of the apps, when you're using the apps, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that they are updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Welles Liu accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the apps.</p>

                    <h3>Updates and Termination</h3>

                    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the apps. The apps are currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the apps to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the apps.</p>

                    <p>Welles Liu does not promise that it will always update the apps so that they are relevant to you and/or work with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the applications when offered to you.</p>

                    <p>We may also wish to stop providing the apps, and may terminate use of them at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the apps, and (if needed) delete them from your device.</p>

                    <h3>Changes to These Terms</h3>

                    <p>We may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>

                    <h3>Contact Us</h3>
